üîê Caesar Cipher: A Foundational Encryption Project
!

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher project! This is a simple, yet powerful, Python script that implements one of the oldest and most basic forms of encryption. As my first step into cybersecurity, this project helped me grasp the core concepts of algorithms and data manipulation.

‚ú® Features
Secure Encryption: Encrypts any text using a user-defined shift key.

Intelligent Decryption: Easily decrypts messages with the same shift key.

Smart Handling: The script intelligently handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Data Integrity: Spaces, numbers, and symbols remain unchanged, preserving the original formatting of your text.

üöÄ How to Run
Clone the repository (if you're using Git):

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Akryptix/caesar_cipher_project.git
cd caesar-cipher-project
Run the script:

Bash

python caesar_cipher.py
Follow the prompts: The script will guide you to enter your message, the shift key, and the desired operation (encrypt/decrypt).

üß† Concepts Explored
This project was a fantastic learning experience and helped me practice key programming and security concepts:

Algorithms & Logic: I designed the core logic for the encryption and decryption process from scratch.

Modular Arithmetic: The use of the % (modulo) operator was crucial for implementing the "wrap-around" logic of the alphabet. This ensures that a shifted Z correctly becomes an A.

Character Encoding: I gained a better understanding of how computers represent characters using ASCII values and how to manipulate them programmatically using ord() and chr().

Conditional Statements: The program uses if/elif/else statements to handle different character types, which is a fundamental skill for any developer.

üìù Next Steps
I am currently exploring more complex cryptographic projects, including creating a brute-force decryption tool for this cipher and possibly building a more advanced substitution cipher.

Feel free to connect with me! I'm always open to feedback and collaboration on future projects.
